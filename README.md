# Microcredit Scoring Project

## Overview

This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to build a predictive model for microcredit scoring. The goal is to assess the creditworthiness of applicants seeking microcredits based on survey data.

## Key Features

- Predictive modeling for microcredit scoring.
- Analysis and preprocessing of survey data.
- Evaluation of different machine learning models.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset in Stata format (`your_dataset.dta`) containing survey responses from microcredit applicants. The dataset includes various features that are crucial for assessing credit risk.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Frandiiiile/Microcredit_scoring.git
    ```

## Usage

Explore the project through Jupyter notebooks, scripts, and modules organized in the repository. The project includes:

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for in-depth analysis.

## Models

The project employs various machine learning models for microcredit scoring, including Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and XGBoost.

## Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report metrics. Refer to the notebooks and scripts for detailed evaluation results.
